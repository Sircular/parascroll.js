# parascroll.js

Parascroll.js provides a simple parallax image scroller that can be easily
incorporated into any website. It is perfect for backgrounds on "hero"-style
elements, but can be used on any element with a background.

## Usage
To mark an element for the parallax effect, simply add the class "parallax-bg"
and the attribute "data-bgurl," like so:
```html
<div class="parallax-bg" data-bgurl="path/to/image.png">...</div>
```
Once you include the script at the bottom of your file, it will automatically
set up parallax scrolling. Note that any elements added dynamically will not be
affected.

## Demonstration
Once I set up the Github Pages site for parascroll.js, I will link it here.
